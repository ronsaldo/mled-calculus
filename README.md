# Mu Lambda Epsilon Delta Calculus
## Proof of concept implementation

This repository contains a proof of concept implementation of our
mu-lambda-epsilon-delta calculus implemented in racket. The only requirement
for exploring the different versions and progressive construction of our
calculus is to have a version racket. Graphviz *dot* utility must be available
on the binary search path so that different graph visualizations can be
generated as .svg files.
